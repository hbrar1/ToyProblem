// Suppose you are creating an internal networking site for your company. You have two data sets to work with.
// The first data set is the employees at your company, and the second is all the pairs of employees who are virtually friends so far.
// It does not matter which employee's ID is in which column, the friendships are bidirectional.
// You want to know whoâ€™s friends with whom.
// You need to implement a function that, given the employees and friendships as parameters,
// returns this data in the form of an adjacency list representation.
// This should associate each employee ID to his/her friends on the site.
