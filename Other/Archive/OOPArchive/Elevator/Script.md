It reduces the amount of bugs and refactoring we need to do, and allows us to scale our projects better because it makes it easier to bring new people on and because the codebase will be designed with efficiency in mind

## Coupling

Coupling refers to the level of interdependence between systems
How much do they depend on one another?
When two pieces of software interface, what assumptions do they have to make about each other?

## 5) Inheritance

## 4) Polymorphism
Ad Hoc Polymorphism vs Parametric Polymorphism

```
2 + 2 => 4

'2' + '2' => '22'
```


## 3) Composition

Bottom up vs top down

Usually preferable to inheritance patterns


## 2) Encapsulation

The tool with which we
