# Toy Problems

A repository full of 175+ data structures and algorithm problems designed to help software engineers pass their technical interviews. These problems are all in JavaScript, and are drawn from a variety of sources, including actual questions software engineers have gotten on interviews, [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) and many more.

This repo is meant for anyone interested in leveling up their problem-solving abilities, so feel free to fork it and look through it. Hopefully you'll find something that helps!

## Future Plans

**More Advanced Problems**

I'm always looking for new and challenging algorithms and data structures to implement so keep an eye out for new additions like Fibonacci Heaps, Quad Trees, Prim's Algorithm and many more!

**Prompts**

Currently what I mainly have are solutions, but I'm hoping to provide prompts, example inputs and outputs, and links to resources on how to solve the problem or where more of an explanation can be found.

**Build Script**

I'm working on incorporating a build script that will create a copy of the folder structure, with stubs for the problems, which you can use to solve the problems yourself!

**General Clean Up**

This repo is constantly evolving and because of that there are likely going to be typos and errors. I'm currently in the middle of restructuring how the files are organized so that it makes the most intuitive sense and keeps things as flat and searchable as possible.

But if you have feedback or thoughts feel free to submit a Github Issue and I'll be more than happy to take a look. And I'm always looking for new problems to solve, so feel free to submit questions either as Issues or email me <harman4422@gmail.com>
